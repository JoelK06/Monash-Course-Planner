              This project was born due to the official Mon Planner being outdated and not 
              including new units (The combination of Mech Aero and Mechatronic engineering units). 
              It was first developed as an excel spreadsheet using lookup tables then later 
              developed into this git hub page where it is free for anyone to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hope is that it may help make someone's course planning just a little easier. 
              Note that as this was a quick project it does not consider credit points, prohibitions, 
              prerequisites, and other such details. The one thing it does do is consider what units 
              run in which semesters, which is helpful for degrees where many units only run once a year.

            <p>Thank you for using my program!</p>
